release time,driver_start,200,Time to start releasing drive alleles into the mosquito population.
release size,num_driver_M,1000,Number of drive heterozygous (WD) male mosquitoes per release.
no. of release patches,num_driver_sites,1,Number of gene drive release sites per year.
dispersal rate,disp_rate,0.01,Adult dispersal rate.

population size factor,alpha0_mean,100000.0,Mean of the baseline contribution to the carrying capacity.
population size variance,alpha0_variance,0.0,Variance of the baseline contribution to the carrying capacity.
|rainfall contribution

output start (full data),rec_start,200,Start time for the full data recording window. Has been set equal to the release time.
output end (full data),rec_end,1500,End time for the full data recording window. Has been set equal to the simulation time.
output frequency (summary data),rec_interval_global,1,Time interval for summary data recording. Has been set to 1.
